## üîÑ Trading Flow (3-Phase Execution)

### Phase 0 (15:45 - Exits)
1. Exit trades (stops, profit targets, time decay)
2. Free up margin for new trades
3. Risk management first

### Phase 1 (15:50 - New Trades + Per-Trade Hedges)
4. Strategy evaluation (find new trade opportunities)
5. Portfolio margin analysis
6. New option trade position sizing
7. Place new option trades (with `FORCE_LIMIT_FILLS=True`)
8. Hedge new trades immediately (per-trade hedging)

### Phase 2 (15:55 - Portfolio Rebalancing)
9. Portfolio delta analysis (includes pending trades from Phase 1)
10. **P2 Delta Band Check**: Calculate current portfolio delta vs. target bands
11. **Margin-Aware Decision Tree**:
    - If within bands ‚Üí No action needed
    - If outside bands ‚Üí Project margin for underlying hedge
    - If margin OK ‚Üí Execute underlying hedge to nearest boundary
    - If margin exceeds limit ‚Üí Reduce option positions using hybrid scoring
12. **Option Reduction Process** (if margin constrained):
    - Score positions by delta/margin/risk efficiency
    - Reduce up to 20% per position (buy to close shorts, sell to close longs)
    - Calculate reduction in dollar-delta units
13. EOD position summary

## üìù Recent Session Summary

### Latest Session (EOD Timing & PnL Explainer Enhancement)
Fixed EOD timing issues and enhanced PnL explainer for better troubleshooting:
- **EOD Timing Fix**: Changed EOD Greeks logging from `AfterMarketClose(0)` to `TimeRules.At(16, 0)` to run at 4:00 PM instead of midnight
- **Vega Addition**: Added vega to EOD Greeks logging line for complete visibility of all four main Greeks (Delta, Gamma, Theta, Vega)
- **Underlying Price Tracking**: Added underlying price information to PnL explainer showing:
  - Current underlying price
  - Previous day's underlying price
  - Price change ($ and %)
  - Helps double-check PnL calculations against market movements
- **Timestamp Debugging**: Added actual algorithm time to EOD debug output to troubleshoot timing issues
- **Log Format**: EOD Greeks now shows: `Œî={delta:.4f}, Œì={gamma:.6f}, Œò={theta:.6f}, ŒΩ={vega:.6f} ({greek_source})`
- **PnL Report Format**: Now includes: `UNDERLYING QQQ: $103.93 | Prev: $102.14 | Change: $+1.79 (+1.75%)`
- **Result**: Better visibility for troubleshooting Greek scaling issues and PnL attribution

### Previous Session (P1D Hedging Override Bug Fix - CRITICAL)
Fixed critical bug where P1D per-trade hedging was still executing and neutralizing deltas despite TRADE bands being configured as "inert":
- **Root Cause**: `_execute_new_trade_hedges()` was always calling `execute_delta_hedge_for_trade()` regardless of TRADE band settings
- **Impact**: With target=0 and tol>=1.0, P1D was hedging to zero (`target $0K`) on every trade, killing equity drift across all backtests
- **Fix**: Added check in `_execute_new_trade_hedges()` to skip P1D entirely when TRADE bands are inert (target=0, tol>=1.0)
- **Result**: Now only P2 NAV-based portfolio rebalancing executes when TRADE bands disabled
- **Log Message**: "P1D HEDGING DISABLED: TRADE bands are inert (target=0, tol>=1.0). Only P2 NAV hedging will run."
- **Validation**: This was the final piece preventing the NAV-only hedging strategy from working correctly

### Previous Session (Options Order Execution Fix)
Successfully fixed options order execution consistency across all modules:
- **Intraday Risk Monitor**: Converted all options Market orders to Limit orders with proper pricing
  - Partial risk reduction (margin threshold exceeded)
  - Full risk reduction (legacy emergency exits)
  - Emergency exits (25% portfolio loss threshold)
- **P2 Rebalancing**: Converted P2 option position reduction from Market to Limit orders
- **Pricing Consistency**: All limit orders use same mid ¬± haircut*spread logic as exit rules
- **Graceful Fallback**: Falls back to Market orders only when no bid/ask quotes available
- **Result**: ALL options orders now use Limit orders with custom fill logic (entry, exit, risk reduction, P2 rebalancing)

### Previous Session (Fill Model Enhancement)
Successfully implemented fill model enhancements and debugging capabilities:
- **Fill Model Force Fills Bug**: Fixed MidHaircutFillModel to properly force fills at exact limit price when `FORCE_EXACT_LIMIT=True`

- **Hybrid Reduction Strategy**: Added configurable option position reduction
- **Overnight Margin Management**: Added configurable overnight margin max
- **Execution Phase Protection**: Risk monitoring properly skips during execution phases
